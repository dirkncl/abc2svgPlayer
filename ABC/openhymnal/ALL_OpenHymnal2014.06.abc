% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely 
% distributable, downloadable database of Christian hymns, spiritual 
% songs, and prelude/postlude music.  This music is to be distributed 
% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the 
% "ABC Plus" format, favored by folk music distributors on the internet.
% All scores will also be converted into pdf, MIDI, and mp3 formats.
% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate 
% translation to a printed score, please consider using "abcm2ps" 
% version 4.10 or later.  I am doing my best to create a final product
% that is "Hymnal-quality", and could feasibly be used as the basis for
% a printed church hymnal.

% The maintainer of the Open Hymnal Project is Brian J. Dumont (brian

% to make sure that no copyright mistakes make it into this database.
% If I am in error, please inform me as soon as possible.
%
% This entire effort has used only free software, and I am indebted to 
% the efforts of many other individuals, including the authors of

% to all of the great Christians who wrote these hymns.
%
% This database comes with no guarantees whatsoever.
%
% I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and
% I will take requests for hymns to add.  My decision of whether to 
% add a hymn will be based on these criteria (in the following order):
% 1) It must be in the public domain or freely distributable
% 2) It must be a Christian piece
% 3) Whether I have access to a printed copy of the music (surprisingly,
%    a MIDI file is usually a terrible source)

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely 
% distributable, downloadable database of Christian hymns, spiritual 
% songs, and prelude/postlude music.  This music is to be distributed 
% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the 
% "ABC Plus" format, favored by folk music distributors on the internet.
% All scores will also be converted into pdf, MIDI, and mp3 formats.
% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate 
% translation to a printed score, please consider using "abcm2ps" 
% version 4.10 or later.  I am doing my best to create a final product
% that is "Hymnal-quality", and could feasibly be used as the basis for
% a printed church hymnal.
%
% The maintainer of the Open Hymnal Project is Brian J. Dumont (brian

% to make sure that no copyright mistakes make it into this database.
% If I am in error, please inform me as soon as possible.
%
% This entire effort has used only free software, and I am indebted to

%
% This database comes with no guarantees whatsoever.
%
% I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and
% I will take requests for hymns to add.  My decision of whether to 
% add a hymn will be based on these criteria (in the following order):
% 1) It must be in the public domain or freely distributable
% 2) It must be a Christian piece
% 3) Whether I have access to a printed copy of the music (surprisingly,

This hymn was written by Martin Luther to teach his 3 year old son about 
Christmas, and became a part of the Luther family Christmas tradition.
One of the adults would dress up as an angel and sing the first 5 verses
to the family.  The rest of the family would sing verses 6 through 15.

%%begintext align
These lyrics are rather obscure, though quite beautiful. The earth (which represents all of 
God's promises to His People, Gen 13:14-15, Rom 4:13-17, Mt 5:5) and the water 
(which represents Baptism and forgiveness, Jn 3:5, Eph 5:25-27, 1Pt 3:21) are frozen and 
lifeless as the Law reigns alone (2Cor 3:6b), with no grace flowing before Christ.  
The Spirit (the wind) works in the world through the condemnation of the Law and the hope for redemption to come
(frosty wind made moan, Micah 4:10, Ez 21:6-7).  Then Christ humbly comes to melt the icy world in
grace.  This then inspires those saved, who recognize that they have nothing to give to Him, to 
finally, through His grace, fulfill the greatest commandment (Mt 22:37).

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

This hymn was written by Fr. Jean de Brébeuf, a French missionary to the Huron (first nations / native American)
people.  He was eventually martyred for the faith by Iroquois during the Iroquois-Huron wars.

"When the Japanese have a Christmas devotional booklet, Mary is a Japanese woman, and her Child
is a Japanese boy.  With that, they are confessing that He was born for them too.  For that 
was the message of the angel, that He was born to be the Savior for all people, and all people
means one of us ... and so whether it is in Papau New Guinea or Japan or among the Eskimos,
when they think of the birth of the Savior they see Him as born one of them." - Dr. Norman Nagel, 22 Dec 2005

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely 
% distributable, downloadable database of Christian hymns, spiritual 
% songs, and prelude/postlude music.  This music is to be distributed 
% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the 
% "ABC Plus" format, favored by folk music distributors on the internet.
% All scores will also be converted into pdf, MIDI, and mp3 formats.
% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate 
% translation to a printed score, please consider using "abcm2ps" 
% version 4.10 or later.  I am doing my best to create a final product
% that is "Hymnal-quality", and could feasibly be used as the basis for
% a printed church hymnal.
%
% The maintainer of the Open Hymnal Project is Brian J. Dumont (brian

% to make sure that no copyright mistakes make it into this database.
% If I am in error, please inform me as soon as possible.
%
% This entire effort has used only free software, and I am indebted to 
% the efforts of many other individuals, including the authors of

% to all of the great Christians who wrote these hymns.
%
% This database comes with no guarantees whatsoever.
%
% I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and
% I will take requests for hymns to add.  My decision of whether to 
% add a hymn will be based on these criteria (in the following order):
% 1) It must be in the public domain or freely distributable
% 2) It must be a Christian piece
% 3) Whether I have access to a printed copy of the music (surprisingly,
%    a MIDI file is usually a terrible source)
% 4) Whether I like the hymn :)

% If you would like to contribute to the Open Hymnal Project, please

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the 
% "ABC Plus" format, favored by folk music distributors on the internet.

% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate

% I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the

% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

S: Music source: the original, the third tune from Archbishop Parker's Psalter, is set to have the Tenors carry the Melody. 
S: It looks as if someone, likely R.V. Williams, reset it to allow sopranos to carry the melody.
S: this is tuned down 2 semitones and sped up from the English Hymnal version.  Slur usage changed per text author.

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

W: 6. That we should look, poor wanderers, to have our home on high!
W: That worms should seek for dwellings beyond the starry sky!
W: And now we fight the battle, but then shall wear the crown
W: Of full and everlasting, and passionless renown.
W: 
W: 7. And how we watch and struggle, and now we live in hope,
W: And Zion in her anguish with Babylon must cope;
W: But he whom now we trust in shall then be seen and known,
W: And they that know and see Him shall have Him for their own.
W: 
W: 8. For thee, O dear, dear country, mine eyes their vigils keep;
W: For very love, beholding, thy happy name, they weep:
W: The mention of thy glory is unction to the breast,
W: And medicine in sickness, and love, and life, and rest.
W: 
W: 9. O one, O only mansion! O paradise of joy!
W: Where tears are ever banished, and smiles have no alloy;
W: The cross is all thy splendor, the Crucified thy praise,
W: His laud and benediction thy ransomed people raise.
W: 
W: 10. Jerusalem the glorious! Glory of the elect!
W: O dear and future vision that eager hearts expect!
W: E'en now by faith I see thee, e'en here thy walls discern;
W: To thee my thoughts are kindled, and strive, and pant, and yearn.
W: 
W: 11. Jerusalem, the only, that look'st from heaven below,
W: In thee is all my glory, in me is all my woe!
W: And though my body may not, my spirit seeks thee fain,
W: Till flesh and earth return me to earth and flesh again.
W: 
W: 12. Jerusalem, exulting on that securest shore,
W: I hope thee, wish thee, sing thee, and love thee evermore!
W: I ask not for my merit: I seek not to deny
W: My merit is destruction, a child of wrath am I.
W: 
W: 13. But yet with faith I venture and hope upon the way,
W: For those perennial guerdons I labor night and day.
W: The best and dearest Father Who made me, and Who saved,
W: Bore with me in defilement, and from defilement laved.
W: 
W: 14. When in His strength I struggle, for very joy I leap;
W: When in my sin I totter, I weep, or try to weep:
W: And grace, sweet grace celestial, shall all its love display,
W: And David's royal fountain purge every stain away.
W: 
W: 15. O sweet and blessèd country, shall I e'er see thy face?
W: O sweet and blessèd country, shall I e'er win thy grace?
W: I have the hope within me to comfort and to bless!
W: O shall I e'er win the prize? O tell me, tell me, Yes!

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the

% I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and

% 2) It must be a Christian piece
% 3) Whether I have access to a printed copy of the music (surprisingly,

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% songs, and prelude/postlude music.  This music is to be distributed 
% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the 
% "ABC Plus" format, favored by folk music distributors on the internet.
% All scores will also be converted into pdf, MIDI, and mp3 formats.
% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate 
% translation to a printed score, please consider using "abcm2ps" 
% version 4.10 or later.  I am doing my best to create a final product
% that is "Hymnal-quality", and could feasibly be used as the basis for
% a printed church hymnal.
%
% The maintainer of the Open Hymnal Project is Brian J. Dumont (brian

%
% This database comes with no guarantees whatsoever.
%
% I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and
% I will take requests for hymns to add.  My decision of whether to 
% add a hymn will be based on these criteria (in the following order):
% 1) It must be in the public domain or freely distributable
% 2) It must be a Christian piece
% 3) Whether I have access to a printed copy of the music (surprisingly,

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely 
% distributable, downloadable database of Christian hymns, spiritual 
% songs, and prelude/postlude music.  This music is to be distributed 
% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the 
% "ABC Plus" format, favored by folk music distributors on the internet.
% All scores will also be converted into pdf, MIDI, and mp3 formats.
% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate 
% translation to a printed score, please consider using "abcm2ps" 
% version 4.10 or later.  I am doing my best to create a final product
% that is "Hymnal-quality", and could feasibly be used as the basis for
% a printed church hymnal.
%
% The maintainer of the Open Hymnal Project is Brian J. Dumont (brian 
% dot j dot dumont at gmail dot com).  I have gone through serious efforts 
% to make sure that no copyright mistakes make it into this database.
% If I am in error, please inform me as soon as possible.
%
% This entire effort has used only free software, and I am indebted to

% to all of the great Christians who wrote these hymns.
%
% This database comes with no guarantees whatsoever.
%
% I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and
% I will take requests for hymns to add.  My decision of whether to 
% add a hymn will be based on these criteria (in the following order):
% 1) It must be in the public domain or freely distributable
% 2) It must be a Christian piece
% 3) Whether I have access to a printed copy of the music (surprisingly,
%    a MIDI file is usually a terrible source)
% 4) Whether I like the hymn :)

% If you would like to contribute to the Open Hymnal Project, please

W: World that spins and spirals down.
W: While our hindered human eyes can't
W: See You turning us around.
W: Give us faith to trust Your mercy, 
W: Make us confident to be
W: Called and holy as Your Church who 
W: Shout and sing Your victory.

W: Called and holy as Your Church who
W: Shout and sing Your victory.

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely 
% distributable, downloadable database of Christian hymns, spiritual 
% songs, and prelude/postlude music.  This music is to be distributed 
% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the 
% "ABC Plus" format, favored by folk music distributors on the internet.
% All scores will also be converted into pdf, MIDI, and mp3 formats.
% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate 
% translation to a printed score, please consider using "abcm2ps" 
% version 4.10 or later.  I am doing my best to create a final product
% that is "Hymnal-quality", and could feasibly be used as the basis for
% a printed church hymnal.
%
% The maintainer of the Open Hymnal Project is Brian J. Dumont (brian

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the 
% "ABC Plus" format, favored by folk music distributors on the internet.

% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% The maintainer of the Open Hymnal Project is Brian J. Dumont (brian

% I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and

% add a hymn will be based on these criteria (in the following order):
% 1) It must be in the public domain or freely distributable
% 2) It must be a Christian piece
% 3) Whether I have access to a printed copy of the music (surprisingly,
%    a MIDI file is usually a terrible source)
% 4) Whether I like the hymn :)

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

W: 6. Naught, naught, can now condemn me Nor set my hope aside;
W: Now hell no more can claim me, Its fury I deride.
W: No sentence e'er reproves me, No ill destroys my peace;
W: For Christ, my Savior, loves me And shields me with His grace.
W: 
W: 7. His Spirit in me dwelleth, And o'er my mind He reigns.
W: All sorrow He dispelleth And soothes away all pains.
W: He crowns His work with blessing And helpeth me to cry,
W: "My Father!" without ceasing, To Him who dwells on high.
W: 
W: 8. And when my soul is lying Weak, trembling, and opprest,
W: He pleads with groans and sighing That cannot be exprest;
W: But God's quick eye discerns them, Although they give no sound,
W: And into language turns them E'en in the heart's deep ground.
W: 
W: 9. To mine His Spirit speaketh Sweet word of holy cheer,
W: How God to him that seeketh For rest is always near
W: And how He hath erected A city fair and new,
W: Where what our faith expected We evermore shall view.
W: 
W: 10. In yonder home doth flourish My heritage, my lot;
W: Though here I die and perish, My heaven shall fail me not.
W: Though care my life oft saddens And causeth tears to flow,
W: The light of Jesus gladdens And sweetens every woe.
W: 
W: 11. Who clings with resolution To Him whom Satan hates
W: Must look for persecution; For him the burden waits
W: Of mockery, shame, and losses, Heaped on his blameless head;
W: A thousand plagues and crosses Will be his daily bread.
W: 
W: 12. From me this is not hidden, Yet I am not afraid;
W: I leave my cares, as bidden, To whom my vows were paid.
W: Though life and limb it cost me And everything I won,
W: Unshaken shall I trust Thee And cleave to Thee alone.
W: 
W: 13. Though earth be rent asunder, Thou'rt mine eternally;
W: Not fire nor sword nor thunder Shall sever me from Thee;
W: Not hunger, thirst, nor danger, Not pain nor poverty
W: Nor mighty princes' anger Shall ever hinder me.
W: 
W: 14. No angel and no gladness, No throne, no pomp, no show,
W: No love, no hate, no sadness, No pain, no depth of woe,
W: No scheme of man's contrivance, However small or great,
W: Shall draw me from Thy guidance Nor from Thee separate.
W: 
W: 15. My heart for joy is springing And can no more be sad,
W: 'Tis full of mirth and singing, Sees naught but sunshine glad.
W: The Sun that cheers my spirit Is Jesus Christ, my King;
W: That which I shall inherit Makes me rejoice and sing.

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely

% the efforts of many other individuals, including the authors of
% the various ABC and ABC Plus software.  Undoubtedly, I am also indebted 
% to all of the great Christians who wrote these hymns.
%
% This database comes with no guarantees whatsoever.
%
% I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and
% I will take requests for hymns to add.  My decision of whether to 
% add a hymn will be based on these criteria (in the following order):
% 1) It must be in the public domain or freely distributable
% 2) It must be a Christian piece
% 3) Whether I have access to a printed copy of the music (surprisingly,
%    a MIDI file is usually a terrible source)
% 4) Whether I like the hymn :)
%
% If you would like to contribute to the Open Hymnal Project, please 
% send an email to me, I would love the help!  PLEASE EMAIL ME IF YOU 
% FIND ANY MISTAKES, no matter how small.  I want to ensure that every 
% slur, stem, hyphenation, and punctuation mark is correct; and I'm sure 
% that there must be mistakes right now.
