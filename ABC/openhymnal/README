The maintainer of the Open Hymnal Project is Brian J. Dumont (brian dot 
j dot dumont at gmail dot com). I have gone through serious efforts to 
make sure that no copyright mistakes make it into this database. If I
am in error, please inform me as soon as possible. This entire effort 
has used only free software, and I am indebted to the efforts of many 
other individuals, including the authors of the various ABC and ABC Plus
software. Undoubtedly, I am also indebted to all of the great 
Christians who wrote these hymns.

This database comes with no guarantees whatsoever.

I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and I 
will take requests for hymns to add. My decision of whether to add a 
hymn will be based on these criteria (in the following order):

   1. It must be in the public domain or freely distributable
   2. It must be a Christian piece
   3. Whether I have access to a printed copy of the music 
      (surprisingly, a MIDI file is usually a terrible source)
   4. Whether I like the hymn :) 

If you would like to contribute to the Open Hymnal Project, please send 
an email to me, I would love the help! PLEASE EMAIL ME IF YOU FIND ANY 
MISTAKES, no matter how small. I want to ensure that every slur, stem, 
hyphenation, and punctuation mark is correct; and I'm sure that there 
must be mistakes right now.
