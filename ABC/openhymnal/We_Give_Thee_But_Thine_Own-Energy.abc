% This file is a part of the Open Hymnal Project to create a freely 
% distributable, downloadable database of Christian hymns, spiritual 
% songs, and prelude/postlude music.  This music is to be distributed 
% as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment parts, 
% in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
% can be freely modified by anyone.  The current format of choice is the 
% "ABC Plus" format, favored by folk music distributors on the internet.
% All scores will also be converted into pdf, MIDI, and mp3 formats.
% Some advanced features of ABC Plus are used, and for accurate 
% translation to a printed score, please consider using "abcm2ps" 
% version 4.10 or later.  I am doing my best to create a final product
% that is "Hymnal-quality", and could feasibly be used as the basis for
% a printed church hymnal.
%
% The maintainer of the Open Hymnal Project is Brian J. Dumont (brian 
% dot j dot dumont at gmail dot com).  I have gone through serious efforts 
% to make sure that no copyright mistakes make it into this database.
% If I am in error, please inform me as soon as possible.
%
% This entire effort has used only free software, and I am indebted to 
% the efforts of many other individuals, including the authors of
% the various ABC and ABC Plus software.  Undoubtedly, I am also indebted 
% to all of the great Christians who wrote these hymns.
%
% This database comes with no guarantees whatsoever.
%
% I would love to get email from anyone who uses the Open Hymnal, and
% I will take requests for hymns to add.  My decision of whether to 
% add a hymn will be based on these criteria (in the following order):
% 1) It must be in the public domain or freely distributable
% 2) It must be a Christian piece
% 3) Whether I have access to a printed copy of the music (surprisingly,
%    a MIDI file is usually a terrible source)
% 4) Whether I like the hymn :)
%
% If you would like to contribute to the Open Hymnal Project, please 
% send an email to me, I would love the help!  PLEASE EMAIL ME IF YOU 
% FIND ANY MISTAKES, no matter how small.  I want to ensure that every 
% slur, stem, hyphenation, and punctuation mark is correct; and I'm sure 
% that there must be mistakes right now.
