w: With our was- sail, was- sail,_ was- sail! And joy_ come to_ our Jol- ly Was- sail. Now_ here at this house_ we first shall be- gin, To drink the King's health which a cus- tom have been, Now un- to the mas- ter we'll drink his good health, We hope he may pros- per in vir- tue and wealth,_ in vir- tue and wealth. With our was- sail, was- sail,_ was- sail! And joy_ come to_ our Jol- ly Was- sail.
