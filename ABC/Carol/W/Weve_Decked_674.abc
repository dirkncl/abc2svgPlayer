w: We’ve decked the Church with I- vy, And hol- ly branch- es gay, We’ve wreathed the shin- ing lau- rel ‘Round font and pil- lars grey; And now we come right glad- ly To join the an- gel strain, Of peace on earth, and glo- ry To God a- gain. A mer- ry, mer- ry Christ- mas, The Church bells ring, A joy- ful, joy- ful Christ- mas, We child- ren sing For Christ was born at Christ- mas, Our Sav- iour King.
