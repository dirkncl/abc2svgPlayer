w: What Child is this_ who, laid to rest_ On Ma- ry's lap_ is sleep- ing? Whom An- gels greet_ with an- thems sweet,_ While shep-_ herds watch_ are keep- ing? This, this_ is Christ the King,_ Whom shep- herds guard_ and An- gels sing; Haste, haste,_ to bring Him laud,_ The Babe,_ the Son_ of Ma- ry.
