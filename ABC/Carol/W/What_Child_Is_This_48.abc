w: What Child is this who, laid to rest On Ma- ry's lap is sleep-__ ing?_ Whom An- gels greet with an- thems sweet, While shep- herds watch are keep- ing? This, this is Christ the King, Whom shep- herds guard and An- gels sing;____ Haste, haste, to bring Him laud, The Babe, the Babe, the Son of Ma- ry.
