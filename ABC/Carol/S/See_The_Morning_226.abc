w: See, the morn- ing fair_ and bright_ Hail the Sa-_ viour come to save All man- kind from end-_ less night! On this day_ Him- self He gave; Left His Fa- ther's throne a- bove, Crown'd with mer-_ cy, peace, and love. Hark! The her- ald an-_ gels sing;_ Make the heav'n-_ ly man- sions ring; All the hosts_ of heav'n pro- claim Christ_ is born,_ Christ is born, Christ_ is born in Beth-_ le hem._
