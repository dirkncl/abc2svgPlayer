w: Ring out, ring out, a joy- ful peal From ev- ery tower and_ stee-_ ple, Tell far and near the glo- rious news, Glad tid-_ ings_ to all peo- ple. That on this ho- ly fes- tal_ morn, The Sav- iour of man- kind was born! That on this ho- ly fes- tal morn, The Sav- iour of man- kind was born! That on this ho- ly fes-_ tal_ morn, The Sav- iour of man- kind was born!
