w: Rich gold from the earth is delved, With toil from deep mines it is torn; Yet by wise men de- vout It was free- ly pour'd_ out, When the King our Lord was born. Fair love is the cost- liest, best, And choic- est of gra- ces that be, This give we to Christ, For His love_ un-_ priced At His glad_ E- pi pha ny.
