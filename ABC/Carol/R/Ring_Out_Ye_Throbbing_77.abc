w: Ring out, ye throb- bing stars of night! Fill all the world with rhy- thmic light For which men long have wait- ed; For which men long have wait- ed! Re- peat the joy- ous song that roll'd From Hea- vens eter- nal depths of old When earth was first cre- a ted, When earth was first cre- a ted! To- ge ther sing! For God doth bring Je- sus,_ the e- ver last ing Lord, To be by all His works a- dored._
