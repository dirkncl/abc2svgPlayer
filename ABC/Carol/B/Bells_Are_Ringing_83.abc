w: The bells are ring- ing_ glad and sweet Be- neath th'a- do ring an- gels' feet, And in our_ hearts are_ glad tho'ts born By ju- bi lant bells of_ Christ- mas morn; For, in a man- ger, poor and low, Was born the Christ- child, years a- go; And shep- herds,_ on the_ hills a- far, Were told the tid- ings_ by a star. O ring, glad bells, ring_ loud and sweet The song the a- ges shall re- peat, Which an- gels_ sing on_ Christ- mas still, Of "Peace on earth," Of "Peace on earth," Of "Peace on_ earth, to men good will."
