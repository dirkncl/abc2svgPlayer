w: Long, long a- go in Beth- le hem The Christ- child came With no one but his Mo- ther sweet, To warm His lit- tle hands and feet, And know His Name How won- der ful to think that He was God of all! No sign of Hea- ven's bright es- tate, To show that He was rich and great, That Babe, so small! O Christ- child sweet, our In- fant King! We child- ren pray Make in our hearts a lit- tle place Where we may keep Thee, by Thy Grace, On Christ- mas Day.
