w: Night of sad- ness, morn of glad- ness, Ev- er more, ev- er, ev- er, Af- ter ma- ny trou- bles sore, Morn of glad- ness, ev- er more and ev- er more. Mid- night scarce- ly pass'd and o- ver, Draw- ing to this ho- ly morn, Ve- ry ear- ly, ve- ry ear- ly Christ was born. Sing out with bliss, His name is this Em- man u el, As was fore- told in days of old by Ga- bri el. Mid- night scarce- ly pass'd and o- ver, Draw- ing to this ho- ly morn, Ve- ry ear- ly, ve- ry ear- ly Christ was born.
