w: Now join we all with ho- ly mirth, To cel- e brate our Sav-_ iour's birth, For He has come from heaven to earth,_ In hum- ble guide and low- ly; The heav'ns the bright- est plan- et lent, That e'er had graced their fir- ma ment, And kings from the far east were sent, To greet this babe so ho-_ ly._
