w: Now, pri- thee, Min-_ strel, tell to me Whose eyes the An-_ gel hosts did see, When loud_ they sang_ in ho- ly glee, That Christ-_ mas night_ in far Ju- dee? "Oh all_ the world_ lay wrapped in sleep, None woke,_ or stirred_ from slum- ber deep, Save just_ a flock of low- ly sheep, And shep-_ herds who_ that flock_ did keep."_
