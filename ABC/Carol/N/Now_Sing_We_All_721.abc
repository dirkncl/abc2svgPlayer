w: Now sing we all full sweet- ly Of Ho- ly Ma- ry's fame! Who for her grace, right meek- ly, Re- ceived her bless- ed name. To save this race of mor- tals, The pro- phets old did say, That Christ would leave heav'n's por- tals, As Man with men to stay; And Ma- ry, pur- est mai- den, By God's most sure de- cree_ Was with this du- ty la- den, His Mo- ther here to be.
