w: In sor- row and in want,_ A- mid the win- ter wild, The Mo- ther Maid, in Beth- lehem's Inn, Brought forth her first- born Child. Be glad, ye hum- ble souls, Sing songs up- on your way; With heart and voice re- joice, re- joice, Your Lord is born to- day! Your Lord_ is born to- day To- day_ in love for you, The choirs of Heaven are sound- ing forth, Their joy- ous Hal- le_ lu!
