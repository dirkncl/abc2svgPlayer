w: I sing the birth_ was born to- night, The Au- thor both_ of life and light: The an- gels so did sound_ it, The an- gels so did sound it, so did sound__ it;__ The like the rav-_ ish'd shep- herds said, Who saw the light_ and were a- fraid, Yet searched, and true they found_ it, Yet searched, and true they found it, True they found_ it,_ and true they found_ it.
