w: On the march_ we saw three mon- archs proud, The fa- bled wise men with their trap- pings gay and bril- liant; March- ing on_ the road to Beth- le hem, They bore rich gifts to greet the Ho- ly Child. The din of drums at the dawn's first beam Pro- claimed the pow'r of the sag- es from the east- ern land, The blare of trumps and the sound of fifes,_ An- nounced their com- ing in the cool gray dawn.
