w: Mor- tals, a- wake, the morn- ing is break- ing, Christ- ians, re- joice, for the day is at hand; See in the man- ger the In- fant a- dor ing, Sheph- erds and An- gels, a won- der ing band. Who is the ten- der Babe gen- tly re- pos ing Mid cat- tle and stran- gers in yon hum- ble stall? Tis Christ the A- noin ted, who, from the be- gin ning, Is Sov'- reign, Cre- a tor, and Lord o- ver all. Hail the In- car nate One, Ho- ly and Glo- ri ous, Sav- iour, Em- man u el, God with us.
