Bless- ed was the Maid who bore Thee, Ma- ry, Mo- ther, meek and mild,_ Bless- ed was she in_ her Child Bless- ed was the food that fed Thee, Bles- sed was the hand that led Thee; Bless- ed was the pa- rent's eye, That watch'd Thy slum- b'ring in-_ fan_ cy._ Vir- gin born! we bow be- fore Thee! Bless- ed was the Maid who bore Thee, Ma- ry, mo- ther, meek and mild,_ Bless- ed was she in_ her child._ Bless- ed was she by all crea- tion Who brought forth the world's sal- va tion; Blest are they and e- ver blest, Who love Thee most and serve Thee best._ Vir- gin born! we bow be- fore Thee! Bless- ed was the maid who bore Thee, Ma- ry, mo- ther, meek and mild,_ Bless- ed was she in_ her child._
