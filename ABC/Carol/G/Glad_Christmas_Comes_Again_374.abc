w: The mer- ry bells for us_ they ring, for us they ring, for us they ring, A mes- sage of great joy_ they bring, great joy they bring, great joy they bring; They tell of Christ_ the lit- tle Child, Of peace, good- will_ and mer- cy mild; They ring o'er earth a sweet re- frain, Glad Christ- mas comes a- gain._ They ring, they ring a sweet re- frain, Glad Christ- mas comes a- gain._
