w: Saint Jo- seph, meek and mild, Em- braced the new- born Child, Then knelt u- pon the sod: The old man, well a- ware That De- i ty lay there, A- dored the Child as God. Full fain was he to own Yon- der Babe,_ the source a- lone Of health and wealth and light, As awe- struck he did_ bless The Sun of righ-_ teous ness. Sooth, 'twas a won- drous_ sight;__ Sooth,_ 'twas a_ won- drous sight.
