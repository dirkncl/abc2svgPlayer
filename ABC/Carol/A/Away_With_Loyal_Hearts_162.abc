w: A- way! with loy-_ al hearts and true, O'er hill_ and dale_ they press'd._ Full four- some wea-_ ry miles to do_ The Cae-_ sar's high be- hest;_ And Ma- ry sang "Mag- ni fi can," Her own, her an- cient song,_ For well_ wist she_ that God's de- cree Was bear-_ ing her_ a- long,_ Was bear-_ ing her a- long._
