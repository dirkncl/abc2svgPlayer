w: All hail to the days that mer- it more praise Than all the rest of the year,_ And wel- come the nights that dou- ble de- lights As well for poor as for peer._ Good for- tune at- tend each mer- ry man’s friend That doth but the best that he may, For-_ get ting old wrong in ca- rols and songs, To drive the cold win- ter a- way._
