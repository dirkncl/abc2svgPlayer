w: As on the night be- fore this hap- py Morn, A bless- ed An- gel un- to Shep- herds told, Where in a sta-_ ble He was poor- ly born, Whom nor the earth nor Heav'n of Heav'ns can hold. Thro' Bethl- 'em rung this News at their re- turn; Yea, An- gels sung that God with us was born; And they made mirth be- cause we should not mourn, And they made mirth be- cause we should not mourn. Their An- gel ca- rols sing we then; To God on High all Glo- ry be, For Peace on earth be- stow eth He, And shew- eth fa- vour un- to men.
