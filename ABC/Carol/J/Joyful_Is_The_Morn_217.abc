w: Once a- gain the ol- den sto- ry, It is sweet for all to sing, How, from realms of won- drous glo- ry, Came our Sa- viour, and our King! Ev'- ry heart this morn re- joi_ ces, Beat- ing with a Christ- ian throne; Count- less thou- sands raise their voi- ces, And re- peat the joy- ous song: "Bright and joy- ful is the morn,_ For to us a child is born;_ From the high- est realm of heav'n_ Un- to us a Son is giv'n!"
