w: O,_ sing we a Ca- rol all blithe and free, And fit for our Christ- mas Morn,_ For the world is as cold as the cold can be, Though its Lord on this Day was born,_ Though its Lord on this Day was born:_ ‘Tis a win-_ try time_ for the rich and poor, And who should be driv’n from a Christ- ian’s door? ‘Tis a win-_ try time_ for the rich and poor, And who should be driv’n from a Christ- ian’s door? And who should be driv’n from a Christ- ian’s door?
