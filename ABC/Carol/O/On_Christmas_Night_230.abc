w: On Christ- mas night true Chris- tians sing, To hear_ what news_ the an- gels bring; News of_ great joy, cause of_ great mirth, Good tid- ings of the Sav- iour’s birth,_ Good tid- ings of_ the Sav- iour’s birth. . . . .__ . . . The King of kings_ to us is given, The Lord of earth_ and King of heav’n; An- gels and men with joy may sing, To see and bless_ this new- born King, To see_ and bless this new- born King.
