w: The_ Shep- herds a- ma zed the An- gels be- hold De- clare the glad tides of the morn; The time is ful- fill'd that the Pro- phets fore- told, And Christ your Re-_ deem er is born. All glo- ry and hon- our to God our Cre- at or, Who came from His glo- ry on high; In hum- ble sub-_ mis sion took_ on Him our na- ture, That we might par- take of His joy.
