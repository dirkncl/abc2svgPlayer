w: Three kings once lived in East- ern land, Full wise were they,_ as wise could be, And 'neath the mid- night sky would stand, To read the stars_ most pa- tient ly. Then once un- to the o- thers said: A star un- known hath come in sight. It goe- th East from o- ver head, And shin- eth like_ a me- teor bright. Star of Beth- le hem, lead the way, Star of Beth- le hem, lead the way, Through the night, till thy bright ray Pale- th with the dawn of day.
