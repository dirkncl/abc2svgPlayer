w: There_ dwelt in old Ju- de a, A_ mai- den fair_ to_ see, The_ moth- er mild and_ un- de filed, Of a bless-_ ed babe was she. Oh!_ No- el sing No- el And mer- ry be al- way, For Christ was born in the ear- ly morn Christ was born in the ear- ly morn, All on a Christ- mas day,_ All on a Christ- mas day.
