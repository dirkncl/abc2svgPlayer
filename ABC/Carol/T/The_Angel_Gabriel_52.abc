w: The An- gel Ga- bri el from God Was sent to Ga- li lee, Un- to a Vir- gin fair and free, Whose name was called Ma- ry. And when the An- gel thi- ther came, He fell down_ on his knee, And look- ing in the Vir- gin's face, He said,_ "All_ hail, Ma- ry." Then, sing we all, both great and small, No- well, No-_ well, No- well; We may re- joice to hear the voice Of An-_ gel_ Ga- bri el.
