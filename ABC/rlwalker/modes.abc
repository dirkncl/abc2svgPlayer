=============================================================================

The descriptions of scales in music textbooks oriented towards Western art
music usually give a misleading idea of the way they are used in Scottish
traditional tunes.  There are better accounts, like the "Mode" article in
the "New Grove Encyclopaedia of Music" or in some texts on jazz harmony,
but these include extra material of no relevance to Scottish idioms.  This
document is intended to help Scottish traditional musicians undo some of
the damage done by high-school music teachers while not taking off into
irrelevant side-issues.  All the theory here is illustrated by real, and
I hope interesting, Scottish traditional music.  The examples are a mix of
very familiar tunes and little-known music from quite obscure sources, to
provide something for everybody; they come from all parts of Scotland and
from all genres of Scottish music.

Why would you need to know about scales and modes?

 * if you play a diatonic instrument, like a whistle or mouth organ,
   knowing exactly what notes you'll need to find tells you whether
   or not you can play a tune.

 * if you play an instrument like the multiple mouth organ or lever-
   sharpened clarsach, which makes switching between different diatonic
   scales a relatively slow operation, it can help you plan easier ways
   to play tunes or sets.

 * some of the most dramatic effects in Scottish music are achieved by
   creative use of its distinctive modes and this helps you understand
   how it's done.

 * if you are creating an accompaniment, this information can help you
   find chords that fit the melody better.

 * it can tell you something about the style and history of a tune.

 * it can help you spot copying mistakes.

 * it can help you plan sets of tunes that go well together, musically
   and practically.

 * it can help you get the idiom right when composing new tunes.

I'm going to assume you can handle ABC notation, either by reading it
directly, printing it out as staff notation, or getting your computer
to play it for you.  This document was developed with Phil Taylor's
BarFly for the Macintosh.  When viewing it with that program, for the
most part you'll want to view it in text mode, and with the "Highlight
note played" option set: that will let you see exactly what's happening
in a tune by animating the playback.  As far as I know there is no DOS,
Windows or Unix program for ABC that animates either ABC source or staff
notation, but any ABC program should be able to play the examples; they
almost all meet the ABC 1.6 standard, and I have not yet heard of anyone
having problems with any tune here.
 
This ***MUST*** be displayed in a monospaced font.  I've laid out the tunes
in such a way as to make the structure clear when viewing them as ABC; in
some cases, depending on the staff notation software, this will make the
music oddly cramped or spread-out when viewed as dots, and you'll need to
edit the linebreaks in a copy of the source to make a useful paper version.
This goes for BarFly too.

The tempi are sometimes meant to be taken seriously, are sometimes wild
guesswork, and I'm not saying which is which.  I use the "G:" header field
(not used much in ABC files on the web) to mean "genre" - this is often
used where other people use the"R:" field, but I find that "R:" has such
unpredictable and implementation-dependent effects with Scottish rhythms
that it's better avoided entirely.

This file may only be redistributed complete and unchanged, either in
computer-readable or paper forms.  In particular, please don't extract
these tunes into any other ABC tunes database.  Since the point of this
document is to analyze them, the copyrighted ones (of which there are
several) are covered by the fair-use doctrine; they won't be if you simply
re-anthologize them without permission from the copyright holder.  This
document may not be used or recommended as a teaching aid for any course
requiring fees from the students without my permission.

I've removed most of the articulation and gracenotes from the tunes; the
point is to make them as readable as possible in ABC source, and some old
software can't handle this detail.  If you want the full details and don't
have access to a print source, email me.

This has been improved by helpful comments from Laurie Griffiths, Henrik
Norbeck, Julia Say, Phil Taylor, and Peter Wilton.

1. Seven-Note Modes
== ================

1.1. Pitch Sets
==== ==========

Nearly all Scottish tunes are based on the usual Western 7-note scale, or
on scales that leave one or two notes out of it.  These scales are made by
selecting seven notes from the 12 in an octave according to the pattern
of the white notes on a keyboard.  The white notes also have names in
tonic sol-fa.  This table describes this pitch set adding the intervals
between successive notes (T for tone, S for semitone):

   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
   C     D     E  F     G     A     B
  do    re    mi fa    so    la    ti
      T     T   S    T     T     T    S

I'm going to use some slightly unusual terminology to avoid unnecessary
confusion; the usual language of music theory makes for muddle when used
to discuss Scottish folk music.  This will make the next few paragraphs
into a bizarre exercise in saying obvious things in a very eccentric way,
but it gets clearer later on.

(Note to sol-fa users: British (Curwen) sol-fa allows the pitches to be
transposed for different keys, whereas some Continental systems don't.
Here, do will always be C, which fits both systems). 

An ABSOLUTE PITCH SET is a collection of notes chosen from the 12 available
that may be used in some order or other to make tunes.  I'm deliberately
not calling these "scales".

The intervals between the white notes of the piano follow a sequence, in
ascending order: tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone.  This
pattern is a RELATIVE PITCH SET.  The pattern can be started at (transposed
to) any point of the 12-note chromatic scale: since the pattern is
asymmetrical, it gives 12 different absolute pitch sets.  I'll name them
after the number of sharps or flats in each, with sharps as positive numbers
and flats as negative:

"^+4" A  B ^c ^d  e ^f ^g||\
"^+5"^A  B ^c ^d  e ^f ^g||\
"^+6"^A  B ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g|]

Usually these are written by putting the sharps and flats at the start
of each line, as they won't change:

The first one and last two are never used in Scottish music except by solo
singer/guitarists with capos.  Since the music is never written that way,
I won't use them in this document - all key signatures will range between
four flats and four sharps.

An important pitch set in Scottish music is that of the Highland bagpipe
chanter, which has nine notes using two sharps:

A pitch set is just a selection of notes you can use in a tune; any real
tune will not just have an absolute pitch set, but also a TONAL CENTRE,
FINAL, or HOME NOTE, which is the pitch in the set that the tune wants to
end on (and usually does, except for some oddities like circular dance
tunes).  "Wants to end on" is vague, and there is no good way to make it
fully precise.  Guitar accompanists and other people thinking in terms of
"common practice" harmony, where every part of a melody is seen as having
an associated underlying chord, will decide the tonal centre by figuring
out what chord sounds best as a close for the tune, or if it doesn't close
in a straightforward way, the one that seems most important to accompanying
it.  But not all Scottish tunes have reasonable chordal accompaniments.

The combination of an absolute pitch set and a tonal centre make up a KEY
(this is an unusually narrow way to use the word, but I'm going to stick
to it here).  This is the same notion of key that ABC uses; what you write
on the "K:" line in the header.

Other musical idioms use different relative pitch sets; it's worth giving
an example.  A scale found in the Eastern Mediterranean is called "zengule"
in Turkish, "mayamalavagaula" or "bhairava" in India, and (on the rare
occasions English speakers need to talk about it) "double harmonic" in
English:

X:0
T:The Zengule Scale
M:8/4
L:1/4
K:C
C_DEF G_ABc|cB_AG FE_DC|]

There is no way to get that from the Western choice of seven notes.

K:C
C ^C  D ^D  E  F ^F  G ^G  A ^A  B  c||
C _D  z  z  E  F  z  G _A  z  z  B  c|]

If you were to make a piano that let you play the zengule scale on the
white keys, you'd end up with two pairs of black keys side by side with
no white key in between them, a single black key in between these pairs
separated from them by two white keys on each side, and three white keys
together.  The piano keyboard wasn't designed in the eastern Mediterranean.
It was designed culturally near enough to Scotland to work for Scottish
music.

Another example from outside Scottish music is the six-note WHOLE-TONE
relative pitch set.  This is used in some folk music from Eastern Europe,
but is most familiar as used by French composers of the early 20th century.
Unlike the white-note scale, it's symmetric: there are only two whole-tone
absolute pitch sets, each taking half of the notes of the chromatic scale:

X:0
T:The Two Whole-Tone Scales
M:7/4
L:1/4
K:C
 C  D  E ^F ^G ^A  c| c ^A ^G ^F  E  D  C||
^C ^D  F  G  A  B ^c|^c  B  A  G  F ^D ^C|]

The symmetry means that none of the six notes has a distinctive position
in these scales.  The result is that there is no tonal centre; whole-tone
melodies wander around randomly and could stop anywhere in the scale.  By
contrast, Scottish music nearly always has a single tonal centre, and the
pitch sets it uses make it easy to locate.

Because the diatonic pitch set has an asymmetric pattern, you can always
tell where the tonal centre goes if you transpose it.  A relative pitch
set and a tonal centre together make up a MODE.  Only four of the seven
notes in the relative pitch set are often used as a home note in Scottish
music; as they appear in the white-note absolute pitch set, these are
C, D, G and A (do, re, so and la).  Two more (E and F) are worth knowing
about to build a clear and simple system describing the whole Scottish
repertoire.

The names given to these modes in Western music theory are about 1000 years
old and make no sense at all.  They are named after places in Greece; this
is because ancient Greek music theorists had an idea (mostly wrong) that
each part of the country had its own special mode.  The mediaeval European
theorists then confused things even further; they thought they were writing
about the same modes as the ancient Greeks but systematically misinterpreted
what the Greek theory said.  After 1000 years it's a bit too late to think
about changing this, so I'm going with the flow.


1.2. The Major Mode
==== ==============

The commonest mode in all the traditional musics of the British Isles is
the MAJOR mode ("ionian" to the mediaeval theorists, "chargah" in Turkish
music theory, "bilaval" in the music of North India, "sankarabharana" in
Carnatic music).  In this scale the "1" pitch (C in the white-note scale)
is the home note.  One common way of describing a scale is by the sequence
of intervals that occur in it as you ascend it for an octave; in the major
scale, this sequence is tone-tone-semitone-tone-tone-tone-semitone, or
TTS TTTS in the abbreviated form I'll use from now on.  Using the sol-fa
"do re mi" system, it is sometimes called the "do-mode" and goes like this:

X:0

For comparison, it may be useful to describe these modes by the sequence
of pitches occurring in them with a common home note: I'll use A, since
this is one of the commonest in Scottish music and the home note of the
pipe chanter.  The major scale for A is AB^cde^f^ga.  Another way to
compare different scales is to pick a fixed absolute pitch set and say
which note in it becomes the tonal centre; I'll use the pitch set of the
pipe chanter.  "The Bens of Jura" uses every note it has, centring on D,
and pipers sometimes call the major mode the "D mode".  Because the word
"mode" is used in other ways in this document, I'll say the D major scale
is the "D-final" seven-note mode on the chanter.

1.4. The Mixolydian Mode
==== ===================

The MIXOLYDIAN mode has semitone 6 as its home note (G in the white-note
scale); interval sequence TTS T TST.  In A, it's AB^cde^fga.  In sol-fa,
it's the so-mode.

1.5. The Minor Mode
==== ==============

The MINOR mode (sometimes called the AEOLIAN mode) is less used in
Scottish music than any of the modes above; it occurs rather more
often in the Highlands, but in the Lowlands it usually takes a
different form described later.  Its home note is semitone 8, or A
in the white-note scale; interval sequence TST T STT.  In A, it's
ABcdefga.  In sol-fa it's the la-mode.

1.6. The Phrygian Mode
==== =================

The PHRYGIAN mode is the white-note scale starting on E; interval sequence
STT T STT.  In A it's A_Bcdefga.  It is very rare in Scottish music, mainly
occurring in street cries and work songs.  In sol-fa it's the mi-mode.

1.7. The Lydian and Locrian Modes
==== ============================

Two other modes named by mediaeval theorists were the LYDIAN and LOCRIAN
modes (the white-note scales beginning on F and B respectively).  The
Locrian mode was never used in practice in the Middle Ages, and has no
relevance at all to Scottish music.  The Lydian mode was used in some
Gregorian chant (perhaps less than the written sources suggest, as some of
it might have become major in performance) and occurs in some Scandinavian
music.  It has a sort of theoretical existence in Scottish music, as it
helps describe, other much more common, modes.  Its interval pattern is
TTT S TTS; in A it's AB^c^de^f^ga.  In sol-fa it's the fa-mode.

Lydian mode would be the G-mode on the pipes, but it's impractical; the G's
are not tuned so as to have any sort of reasonable harmonic relationship
with other notes on the chanter, and are not even exactly an octave apart,
so the G-mode is only used for a few desperate efforts at arranging non-pipe
music which is actually in G major.  Locrian mode would be the C-final mode,
but the C on the chanter is the most strangely tuned of all, with no other
note having any detectable harmonic relationship to it.

2. Hexatonic Modes
== ===============

2.1. The Hexatonic Pitch Set
==== =======================

Many Scottish tunes don't use all seven notes of the diatonic pitch set.
The same procedure occurs in non-Western musical systems: in classical
Indian music, modes derived by leaving notes out of a raga are called
"secondary ragas".
 
There are many theoretically possible scales like this, but only a few are
used.  The six-note modes of Scottish music can all be seen as different
modes of the white-note pitch set with B (ti) left out, or alternatively
as its transposition down a fourth, the set with F (fa) left out, which
also fits the white notes.  The interval sequence now has a wider gap, a
minor third, written as m:

   -ti:   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
          C     D     E  F     G     A
         do    re    mi fa    so    la
            T     T    S   T     T      m

or else by leaving F out, which is the same pattern transposed:

   -fa:   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
          C     D     E        G     A     B
         do    re    mi       so    la    ti
             T     T      m       T     T    S

There are two different ways to get this pitch set on the pipe chanter:
either omit the C sharp (so that the single semitone gap is between
F sharp and G) or omit the G's (so that the semitone falls between C sharp
and D).  Nobody seems to have named these before; I'll call the first
the "C-gap hexatonic pitch set" and the second the "G-gap hexatonic pitch
set".  Pipe tunes using the C-gap set work well on a G whistle.

The six-note scales have no popular names, so I've used the naming system
of Campbell and Collinson in their "Hebridean Folksongs", which describes
these by saying what seven-note modes they could be if the missing note
were filled in

Some of the tune examples I've given for gapped scales are long: this is
necessary for one point I'm making, that certain notes are omitted in a
regular pattern.  If a note doesn't occur in a short phrase you might
put it down to fluke, but if a 64-bar piece omits it you need to ask why.


2.2. The Major/Mixolydian Hexatonic Mode
==== ===================================

The MAJOR/MIXOLYDIAN HEXATONIC mode uses the white-note pitch set, but
starting on C; that is, a major or mixolydian scale with the seventh step
omitted, giving an interval sequence TTS TTm.  In A it's AB^cde^fa.  This
is one of the commonest modes in Scots music: it occurs more often than
the seven-note mixolydian mode, and many Scottish "major" tunes make so
little use of the seventh that a gap here is barely noticeable.  In sol-fa,
it's either the do-mode with ti omitted or the so-mode with fa omitted.

On the pipes, this mode can be obtained two ways: either as the A-final
mode of the G-gap hexatonic pitch set, or (less usually) as the D-final
mode of the C-gap hexatonic pitch set.

2.3. The Dorian/Minor Hexatonic Mode
==== ===============================

The DORIAN/MINOR HEXATONIC mode is the result of using either D as the home
note for the six-white-note pitch set; a dorian or minor scale with the sixth
omitted, interval sequence TST TmT.  In A it's ABcdega.  This is very common;
the great majority of the older Scottish tunes usually described as "minor"
are in fact in this mode, and it is much commoner than both the dorian and
minor modes put together.  In sol-fa, it's either the re-mode with ti omitted
or the la-mode with fa omitted.

It can also be the E-final mode in the C-gap hexatonic pitch set, but
this is uncommon.

There are many tunes nearly in this mode, where the sixth is only used
as a passing note in scale patterns, like the inconspicuous c's in this:

The gap sometimes got filled as tunes evolved.  "When She Cam Ben She
Bobbit", as it appeared in Burns and Johnson's Scots Musical Museum,
was dorian/minor hexatonic:

In Allan's "110 Songs of Scotland" from the late nineteenth century and
intended to fit Lady Nairne's adapted words, it had gone into the minor,
though the sixth is still not an important note:

2.4. The Mixolydian/Dorian Hexatonic Mode
==== ====================================

The MIXOLYDIAN/DORIAN HEXATONIC mode has the third omitted, giving an
interval sequence TmT STT.  In A it's ABde^fga.  So on the pipes, one
form of it is in the A-mode in the C-gap hexatonic pitch set; this occurs
often.  The other is the E-mode in the G-gap pitch set, and if there are
any real examples of it I can't find them.  In sol-fa it's either the
so-mode with ti omitted or the re-mode with fa omitted.

2.5. The Lydian/Major Hexatonic Mode

The LYDIAN/MAJOR HEXATONIC mode omits the fourth, giving an interval
sequence TTm TTS.  In A it's AB^cef^ga.  In sol-fa it's either in the
fa-mode with ti omitted or the do-mode with fa omitted.

On the pipes it is theoretically possible as the D-mode using the
G-gap hexatonic pitch set, but I can't think of an example.  When
the G is omitted in a D-mode tune on the pipes, the C is too, to
make the tune pentatonic.  The first half of this tune is in this
mode, but the Gs in the second part fill in the gap:

2.6. The Minor/Phrygian Hexatonic Mode
==== =================================

The MINOR/PHRYGIAN HEXATONIC mode has interval sequence mTT STT, or Acdefga
in A.  In sol-fa it's either the la-mode with ti omitted or the mi-mode with
fa omitted.

It's not very common.  This weird tune comes from a limited-circulation sheet
published for Alexander Campbell (later the editor of "Albyn's Anthology" of
Highland music) late in the 18th century.  It seems never to have been
reprinted since, and there's no indication of where Campbell got it, unless
he wrote it himself, which given his limited talents is unlikely.  It would
be a natural companion for one of the many reels in A major/mixolydian
hexatonic.

On the pipes minor/phrygian hexatonic can be the B-mode with the C-gap

never occurs.  This must be by far the best-known tune in the mode:

3. Pentatonic Modes
== ================

3.1. The Pentatonic Pitch Set
==== ========================

The PENTATONIC pitch set leaves out pitches 5 and 12 to leave five notes,
1 3 6 8 12 (or C D F G A in white notes, or only the black notes).  Its
intervals are three whole tones and two minor thirds, no semitones.  There
are three ways of getting transpositions of it from the white notes of a
piano:

   -mi -ti:   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
              C     D        F     G     A
             do    re       fa    so    la
                 T      m       T     T      m

   -fa -ti:   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
              C     D     E        G     A
             do    re    mi       so    la
                 T     T      m       T      m

   -do -fa:   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
                    D     E        G     A     B
                   re    mi       so    la    ti
                       T      m       T     T     m

It has different modes like the seven-note and six-note pitch sets. There
are three pentatonic modes used in Scottish music, and a fourth which has a
sort of theoretical existence.  There are countless other ways of selecting
five notes; none of them seem to have much place in Scottish tradition.
(In particular, the pentatonic pitch sets of African music typically don't
fit any Scottish tunes).

On the pipes, with their two-sharp scale, there are also three alternate
ways to get this pitch set.  One is the CF-gap set, GAB-de-ga.  Another is
the GC-gap set, AB-def-a.  The third possibility is the DG-gap pitch set,
ABc-ef-a.  Each of these can be used with a variety of tonal centres to get
different modes: and because of the limited range and non-uniform tuning of
the pipe chanter, each has a different effect.


3.2. The Mixolydian/Dorian/Minor Pentatonic Mode
==== ===========================================

The MIXOLYDIAN/DORIAN/MINOR PENTATONIC mode has pitch 8 (G in this white-
note scale) as its home note.  That is, it's what you get from the black-note
scale by taking G sharp/A flat as the home note, or from the white-note
minor, dorian or mixolydian scales by leaving out the third and sixth.  Its
interval sequence is TmTmT.  In A, it's ABdega.  This is a very common scale
in Highland pipe music.  There are three ways of looking at it in sol-fa.

Since both the C and F are missing, you might equally well find that tune
written with one or two sharps; they make no difference.  You could look at
this a different way by saying the tune could equally well be minor, dorian
or mixolydian; a pentatonic mode is ambiguous three ways if you see it as
a reduced form of a seven-note mode.

One oddity of the piano keyboard layout may explain why the piano accordion
works so well for Highland pipe tunes.  The mixolydian/dorian/minor
pentatonic scale fits on the white notes no matter whether you use G, D or A
as the home note; this is one of the commonest scales in Highland music and
these are by far the commonest home notes any Scottish music uses.  Watch an
accordionist's fingers: when playing Highland music like pipe marches, the
black notes are rarely touched, despite frequent key changes.

In principle, there are three ways to get this mode on the pipes: by far the
commonest uses the A-mode with the CF-gap pitch set, but in principle it can
be fitted to the E-mode on the GC-gap set or the B-mode on the DG-gap set.

Tunes in this mode could often have the gap filled or created.  It is not
clear which of these (the same tune in two different rhythms) came first:

3.3. The Dorian/Minor/Phrygian Pentatonic Mode
==== =========================================

The DORIAN/MINOR/PHRYGIAN PENTATONIC mode is what you get by playing on the
black notes of a piano taking E flat/D sharp as the home note.  Tunes in
this mode could be seen as being dorian, minor or phrygian; the second and
sixth are omitted.  Its interval sequence is mTTmT.  In A, it's Acdega.  It
is sometimes called "pentatonic minor".  On the pipes it can be played as
the E-mode in the CF-gap pitch set or as the B-mode in the GC-gap pitch set.
In sol-fa it can start on re, la or mi.

3.4. The Lydian/Major/Mixolydian Pentatonic Mode
==== ===========================================

The LYDIAN/MAJOR/MIXOLYDIAN pentatonic scale (with gaps at the 4th and 7th)
occurs frequently in pipe music.  Its interval sequence is TTmTm; in A it's
AB^ce^fa.  That's its usual form on the pipe chanter: A-mode in the DG-gap
pitch set.  It can also be D-mode in the GC-gap set.  In sol-fa it can begin
on so, do or la.

Other A-final tunes have the D and G in such inconspicuous places that nobody
but a piping contest judge would notice if you left them out and covered
their absence by holding the previous note, putting them entirely into the
same pentatonic mode.  In this tune they only occur as the second note of a
two-note upbeat:

Some people call this "pentatonic major".  It is a strong enough feature
of Scottish music that tunes originally in seven-note modes have been
adapted to it in folk transmission.  "Miss Cruickshank's Reel", by William
Marshall (first published as "Miss Hopkins Reel" in 1781), was in the major
mode (originally in B flat - I've transposed it for easier comparison) the
way he wrote it:

3.5. The Major/Mixolydian/Dorian Pentatonic Mode
==== ===========================================

The MAJOR/MIXOLYDIAN/DORIAN PENTATONIC mode is what you get by playing on
the black notes of the piano, taking C sharp as the home note.  It could
be taken as being major, mixolydian or dorian; the third and seventh are
missing.  Its interval sequence is TmTTm; in A it's ABde^fa.  It could be
done on the pipes as the A-mode with the GC-gap pitch set, or the D-mode
with the CF-gap set.  But it doesn't appear to be used as the sole mode in
any Scottish tune; some pipe tunes come close for long stretches, but where
there are notes that bridge the gaps, they matter.  In sol-fa, it can start
on do, so or re.

4. The Big Picture
== ===============

The relationships between the modes and gapped scales can be summarized in
a single diagram: six 7-note modes, five 6-note modes, four 5-note modes.
The numbers from +1 to -4 indicate the change in the key signature, relative
to the major scale, if the home note is kept the same: sharps are positive,
flats negative.  So lydian mode has one more sharp (or one less flat) than
the major key with the same tonal centre; dorian has two less sharps (or two
more flats) and so on.  The gapped scales have alternative key signatures
(two alternatives for hexatonic modes, three for pentatonic).  Each mode in
the diagram can be contructed either by taking all the notes that occur in
both modes immediately below it, or by taking those notes that are in common
to both modes immediately above it.  I've also included the pipe (two-sharp)
versions of each mode.

I have indicated the relative frequency of these in the older repertoire,
as I see it after an informal scan of a lot of books, though not using a
pocket calculator:

   ++  very common
   +   common
   -   rare
   --  very rare
   --- nonexistent

I have no explanation for this pattern.  Breandan Breathnach in "The Music
and Dances of Ireland" gives a frequency breakdown of the 7-note modes of
Irish music, concluding that it was the same across the British Isles; I
don't think this would still hold if gapped modes were taken into account -
English and Irish music are more similar to each other than either is to
Scottish music in this respect, just as they are more closely related to
each other rhythmically.

A similar scheme, with more modes (most of which don't correspond to
anything in Scottish music, and some to nothing in any music) was used
by Bertrand Harris Bronson in his "The Traditional Tunes of the Child
Ballads".  I would be interested to know of real examples that don't
fit my scheme.

A table of the numbers of sharps (+) and flats (-) in these modes:

             lyd maj mix dor min phr

    D flat   -4   .   .   .   .   .
    A flat   -3  -4   .   .   .   .
    E flat   -2  -3  -4   .   .   .
    B flat   -1  -2  -3  -4   .   .
    F         0  -1  -2  -3  -4   .
    C        +1   0  -1  -2  -3  -4
    G        +2  +1   0  -1  -2  -3
    D        +3  +2  +1   0  -1  -2
    A        +4  +3  +2  +1   0  -1
    E         .  +4  +3  +2  +1   0
    B         .   .  +4  +3  +2  +1
    F sharp   .   .   .  +4  +3  +2
    C sharp   .   .   .   .  +4  +3
    G sharp   .   .   .   .   .  +4

and the hexatonic and pentatonic modes have alternatives derived from that
list; so E mixolydian/dorian/minor pentatonic has 1, 2 or 3 sharps, which
makes it playable on either a G, D or A whistle or possibly all three,
depending on the tune's range.


5. Misleading Final Notes
== ======================

In most European art music, the final note of a tune is its tonal centre.
In many Scottish tunes, it isn't; this is very often the case with dance
tunes intended to be repeated indefinitely in a circular pattern, but it
often occurs with songs as well.  Probably the commonest type are those
ending on the third:

X:0

Pibroch can have a greater degree of ambiguity.  While the pipes always
provide an A on the drones, this is not always the tonal centre of the
melody played over them, and this piece seems to have no tonal centre at
all, floating from one to the next in a repetitive pattern like that of
English bellringing.  The "words" at the right are in canntaireachd, the
syllabic notation used to record and transmit pipe music until about 1800;
they describe the pitches and the gracenotes, but not the exact rhythm of
the piece.

6. Multiple Modes in the Same Tune
== ===============================

Some tunes switch mode partway through; a trick that is only possible with
the human voice or a chromatic instrument like the fiddle.   The oldest
notated version of "Tibbie Fowler" is very simple: 

X:0
T:Owin at her
G:song or reel
S:Margaret Sinkler MS, Glasgow 1710
M:4/4
L:1/4

K:Ddor
A|GGGA|FFcA|GGGA|F>ED:|
f|dddf|cAfc|ddde|f>edg|
  fdfc|AFcA|GGGA|F>ED|]

Later versions are often like this one.  It has a sixth gap, but the third
varies between natural and sharp, making it a mixture of dorian and mixolydian:

X:0
T:Tibbie Fowler of the Glen
G:country dance
S:Duke of Perth MS (NLS MS 21715)

a|fddf  c>dcA|fdde  f>gag|fddf      AFcA|dGGA ^F>ED:|

This is a common feature of Scandinavian music.  It even gets applied to
tunes of non-Scandinavian origin.  In a collection of 1650 by John Playford
there is a tune, probably Scottish, called "Stingo", straightforwardly in
the minor mode:

X:0
T:Stingo
G:dance song
M:6/8
L:1/8
Q:3/8=108

B2B B2A/B/|c2c c2c |d2d  g2g|d3 f3 |
B2B B2A/B/|c2c c>de|dc>B cA2|G3 B3|]

Thirty years later it had turned into "Lulle me beyond thee" in the
dorian/minor hexatonic scale with sharpened leading notes:

X:0
T:Lulle me beyond thee
G:song or dance
M:6/8
L:1/8

a>ba g>fe|f>ed a3 |A2A f>ed|^c3 d3|]

John Hamilton gave it new words early in the 19th century, with a dorian
first half and the second half in the minor with sharpened leading note:

X:0
T:Up in the Morning Early
G:song
S:Gall and Inglis, Select Songs of Scotland

  B>cB B<BB|cdf g2f/e/|d>cB A>G^F |G3 d2|]

and it turned up in Shetland a few centuries later, adapted under Norse
influence into a far more subtle tune that goes through dorian, mixolydian
and major:

X:0

A2B c2d|efe e2c|A2B c2G|E3 C2B|A2A F2D|A2A F2D|A2d d2c|d3 D3|]

The pipe march "The Conundrum" is more complex, progressively filling in
gaps from one section to the next.  The first part omits both G and D,
fitting the mixolydian/major/lydian pentatonic scale.  The second part fills
in one gap, inconspicuously adding a few Gs to make the tune major/lydian
hexatonic.  The third part makes them slightly more noticeable.  The last
part adds Ds as well; the tune only becomes unambiguously in the major mode
near the end.

This procedure, of only filling in a gap at the very end of the tune to
create a climax, is common in all kinds of Scottish music.  The idea goes
back a very long way.  Here is a mediaeval piece in the style of a French
religious song, and perhaps composed by a Frenchman; it's one of the
oldest pieces of music known from Scotland.  It's in the dorian mode, but
the first three sections are dorian/minor hexatonic, with progressively
more dorian E's introduced as the piece builds to a climax.

All the examples so far are of gradual and subtle shifts, moving between
adjacent points in the mode diagram.  Shifts follow the lines marked in
the Big Picture (that is, there are no shifts between gapped scales with
the same number of gaps; the only moves that occur are the opening and
filling of gaps, or changes of one step at a time in seven-note modes).
This is quite unlike the usual procedure in art music, where changes of
mode tend to be dramatic and unmistakable, usually between major and minor.
There are some examples like that in folk music, but they usually feel like
conscious exercises in weirdness.  There is nothing subtle about this:

[A2D2] Bd b2  af   |[e3A,3] d/e/ [d4A4D4] |]

That startling shift is from the lydian/major/mixolydian pentatonic mode
direct to the mixolydian; the gap at the fourth (G) is not filled in first,
as a move through the major/mixolydian hexatonic mode would require.  This
tune is from a manuscript of lute music predating the general use of the
fiddle, and from the Borders, where the bagpipe had a long history.  It
may even be as old as the event it is thought to commemorate, the Battle
of Flodden in 1513; perhaps it records an old and local kind of tonality.
The basic melody has a nine-note range from A to b, suggesting a chanter
with either one extra note above a one-octave A dorian scale, or two above
a G mixolydian scale.

This tune, noted down in the Borders around 1800, shifts in a similarly
emphatic way from minor to major, and more subtly back again:

This tune (originally for the harp, but best known in a slightly

Breathnach points out that this high F natural is common in Irish
music, where it's generally reached by a slide from below.  Whistle
players often play that tune with one of those Irish-style slides;
obviously Rory Dall's harp can't have done that, and it seems to be
a folk-revival idea of very recent times.


7. Leading Notes and Alternate Rising/Falling Modes
== ================================================

In some traditions like Arabic music, modes are more complicated in always
having two alternate forms used when the melody is rising or falling.  In
Scottish music it sometimes happens like this:

which is in the major mode, but the seventh only occurs in ascending lines.
Or this:

c|c2 c>B|c>d e>c|c<B B>A|B>c d>f|e>c B>A|A>B c>B|A>F F>E|E3|]

which would be dorian/mixolydian hexatonic except for the use of the G in
the rising sequence in bar 4.  Scale patterns and sequences often result
in gaps getting filled in; they are more frequent in English and Irish
music, which is why they use gapped scales less often than Scottish tunes.

Distinct rising/falling mode occurs frequently in Western classical music
with minor-key tunes (as "sharpened leading notes").  These asymmetric
scales are more common in the Lowlands, perhaps because harp and bagpipes
were not such dominant influences.  (They're also common in Simon Fraser's
Highland music transcriptions of  from the early 19th century, but Fraser
was equally unreliable as a historical or musical source: he wrote what he
imagined he heard - Highland peasants trained to sing Mozart).

And the sixth gap got filled in with a later version of "An caora crom",
using the art-music minor scale where the sixth is sharpened, though it
is still not an important note in the tune:

It happens much earlier.  This is from the Skene Manuscript of lute tunes
from 1625; this is a still-well-known tune, in the mixolydian/dorian
hexatonic mode.  Among the fast scales at the end, the gap is filled in
and a sharpened leading note is introduced.  The manuscript was heavily
influenced by the art music of the time.

David Johnson's "Scottish Fiddle Music in the Eighteenth Century" has a
substantial discussion of how art music influenced traditional music; most
of it is beyond the scope of this document.  And any classically-oriented
music theory text will explain the various forms of the minor mode and
where they tend to be used.  This is the appropriate framework to describe
some of the more consciously "artistic" work of the Gows, Marshall and Scott
Skinner; but this is a small part of the Scottish repertoire, and, as in the
example of "Miss Cruickshank's Reel", modal idiom has a habit of taking over
once these tunes get into circulation.

"Fy gar rub her o'er with straw" is a song first noted about 1700, but
perhaps much older.  This version of the 1760s for the flute changes mode
on rising phrases:

There are other tunes like this where the sixth rather than the seventh is
the note that gets sharpened on rising phrases. Perhaps this was a local
development of the art-music minor scale in a more idiomatically Scottish
direction.  But the classical minor scale was thoroughly incorporated into
traditional music long ago and is now an integral part of it.


8. Relative Mode Shifts
== ====================

A common trick in classical music is to shift between major and minor keys
using the same number of sharps or flats, like between C major and A minor;
this involves shifting the tonal centre.  There are a few tunes in a
traditional style that do this:

mixolydian/dorian hexatonic in A and dorian in E:

This is a natural way of getting tonal variety on a bagpipe, since
changing the key signature is impossible.  It can be useful on other
instruments.  Here's an example of a set I constructed to play with
a friend who uses a lever harp.  It never changes the absolute pitch
set, so she never needs to flip a lever.  And for the hell of it,
there is no change in rhythmic pattern either, until the very last
tune.  Instead the variety comes from a continual change in tonal
centre.  It also alternates familiar and rarely-played tunes.

Some of the oldest tunes in the repertoire make systematic alternations
in mode between two tonal centres one step apart; most commonly between
the dorian mode and the relative major below it, or the mixolydian mode
and the relative minor below it.  This technique is usually called a
DOUBLE TONIC.  It seems o be particularly common in 9/8 tunes, like these
two jigs where each half starts in the dorian and ends on the major a step
below.  Almost all 9/8 tunes are circular dance melodies; the bars in the
major are intended to lead back to a repeat.  (The first is also known in
England and Ireland under a variety of names; the second is one of the
oldest of a family of tunes which includes the recent Irish slip jig "The
Butterfly").  This kind of tune probably originated in northern England
late in the 17th century as a variant of the older 3/2 hornpipe.

Double tonic tunes may take a more emphatic form where the shift is not
between two relative modes, but between two keys with different signatures.
This tune hints at that.  It's mostly in E dorian, but each part ends
in D, the same tonal shift as the previous two tunes.  The E tonality is
reinforced by a sharpened leading note:

That tune may have been around for a while, but it still sounds more like a
joke that caught on than an organic outgrowth of the older Scottish idiom.

The next piece may have started out as a double tonic tune, but has ended
up alternating between G mixolydian and almost every imaginable tonality
with the same key signature.  It's heptatonic, perhaps a transcription of
a Lowland pipe tune, but whereas almost all pipe tunes set a definite tonal
centre in the odd-numbered bars, this one does it in the even-numbered ones.
(The title means "the well-filled codpiece").

9. Other Key Changes
== =================

Art music has heavily influenced most forms of popular music, but has had
little impact on Scottish traditional idiom.  One feature common to almost
all British popular song since 1800, and almost totally absent from Scottish
music, is changes of tonal centre while keeping in the same mode ("change of
key" in more usual terminology).  Pieces that do this, and have managed to
enter the Scottish repertoire, still sound decidedly different from the main
body of tunes composed in the modal system.  This sentimental song from the
late 1790s modulates to A (in art-music theory, the "dominant") in bars 5
and 6:

Guitarists like this sort of thing because it gives them more chords to try
and lets them use what they already know.  The rest of us can do without it.
One of the few examples of such change of key (again, from D to A) that still
manages to sound like a traditional tune is this:

10. More on Bagpipes and Other Limited-Range Instruments
=== ====================================================

The Highland pipe uses a scale which is nearer to the Mixolydian mode than
to anything else in the Western system (it is almost identical to one used
in mediaeval Arabic music, which is presumably coincidence).  It is written
as if based on A, though the actual pitch is B flat.  The two tenor drones
of a Highland pipe are tuned an octave below the low A on the chanter, with
the bass drone (added in the 18th century) an octave lower.  When Highland
pipe tunes are played on other instruments, they are nearly always played at
the written pitch of A, with the other notes of the scale brought into line
with the Mixolydian scale.  (Bad fiddle transcriptions often get this wrong,
and sharpen the G's to produce a major key).  There are only nine notes in
the standard chanter scale; some chanters and some fingerings can produce
more, but these are never called for in traditional pipe music.  A large
proportion of the tunes in the Scottish repertoire fit this scale, even if
they are not part of the pipe repertoire today.  Whether this is because
they were originally pipe tunes, or because the pipes were designed to play
Scottish vocal tunes that already fell into that scale, is anybody's guess.

Written Highland pipe music usually omits any key signature - the two
sharps are taken as read.  Older sources may put the two sharps in
explicitly.  Some sources may even use three sharps; in that case, just
ignore the sharp on the G.  David Glen's books from the nineteenth century
used the ingenious trick of giving the key signature as a pianist or
fiddler would play the tune - tunes in his collections have signatures
ranging from zero to three sharps, all of which a piper would ignore.

Lowland pipes have a similar conical-bore chanter to Highland pipes and
use a similar scale.  Some older smallpipes, with a parallel-bore chanter,
used a shifted scale with the tonal centre at the bottom of the range and
providing one or two higher notes; in A major, ABcdefgab, or G major,
GABcdefga.  They are less standardized than Highland or Lowland pipes and
some old examples have even had their chanter fingerholes recut to alter
their basic mode.  This is a typical Border smallpipe tune for a mixolydian
chanter with the extended range, GABcdefga:

The tune uses the same gap-filling development as the Highland tunes quoted
before; the first part is major/mixolydian hexatonic, the second mixolydian.
But here the effect is much more dramatic and unmistakable, the natural f's
becoming more and more strongly accented up to the climax in bar 20.

Pipe tunes frequently use pentatonic or hexatonic scales of the types
described above.  Among the seven note modes, the commonest are the
mixolydian mode (for tunes written as ending on A) and the major mode
(tunes ending on D).

Most Scottish tunes tend to have the home note at the lower end of the
tune's range, with no more than one note below.  The mediaeval theorists
who invented the naming system for the 7-note modes classified tunes like
that as being in AUTHENTIC modes.  Some melodies of Gregorian chant have
a very limited range, to meet the lowest common denominator among the
monks' voices.  This is the same problem the bagpipe faces with its nine-
note scale; the only modes that have a tonal centre in two octaves are
the A-final ones.  Unlike most major-mode tunes, D major tunes for the pipes
have only one home note, in the middle of the range, rather than two an
octave apart.  The mediaeval theorists described tunes like this as being
in PLAGAL modes; each of the seven modes they recognized had both authentic
and plagal forms, with different ranges.  (In my examples of hexatonic
major/mixolydian tunes, "The Smith's a Gallant Fireman" is authentic;
"Braw, Braw Lads of Galla Water" and "Haste to the Wedding" are plagal).
This distinction vanishes completely with the fiddle; tunes predating the
fiddle were often adapted by fiddlers with the range greatly extended.
Major-key tunes that don't fall into either the authentic or plagal forms
drive whistle players nuts:

Almost all versions of it go down to F sharp, and the note matters to the
tune; that makes it unplayable on a G whistle, and it needs an accurate
C natural (not always easy) if played on a D whistle.  It's most often
played transposed to D, which makes it impossible on a D whistle, the
commonest size.  As for a bagpipe, forget it.  The tune probably came from
sixteenth-century England, which may explain its oddity.

The pipe chanter is not an exact fit to the authentic/plagal distinction;
nothing in mediaeval music theory corresponds to the B-final and E-final
modes, where the tonal centre is not in the middle of the range.

Pipe tunes often have a basic melody in a gapped scale, but have the gaps
filled in by upbeats or grace notes.  It is quite rare for a full setting
of a pipe tune to have the grace notes exactly matching the gapped-scale
mode of the tune.  In particular it is difficult not to use g as a frequent
grace note.

The low and high G's on the pipes are often treated differently.  The high
g is a relatively quiet note, while the low G is the loudest on the chanter
and hence the harshest dissonance against the drones (Alastair Campsie,
describing his pibroch for Hugh MacDiarmid, writes that it "resembles
nothing more than the spirit screaming against the insensate violence of
the world").  And the two notes are not exactly an octave apart.  So the
high g is used more, and there are many tunes that omit the low G while
using the high one.

Gaps can occur other places in the scale.  This one eliminates the sixth
from a mixolydian scale:

This one would be mixolydian/dorian/minor pentatonic, except that
the g's are included (to my ears they sound just plain weird, and
they are normally played sharp when the tune is done on fiddle or
accordion).  So it doesn't use the normal hexatonic pitch set.

patterns:

12. Cheating
=== ========

Many Scottish tunes almost have gaps; that is, the relevant notes are
in inconspicuous places in the tune.  Often these tunes are the result
of a historical process of gap-filling.  Either going back to an older
version of the tune, or else imagining a retrograde evolution to a
gapped scale even if there never was one, may result in something
becoming playable on a diatonic instrument that otherwise couldn't do
it.  In practice, Scottish players do this instinctively all the time.

Like almost all Scottish tunes in the minor mode, the sixth occurs rarely
and only in the middle of a scale run.  Suppose you haven't got an F natural
on your instrument, but do have all the other notes (for example, a tin
whistle in D or a G/D melodeon).  Nobody's going to notice if you play this
instead:

Or if all you've got is a diatonic mouth organ in A, you can still play
mixolydian tunes from the pipe repertoire.  It's unusual for the high g's
to really matter; lengthening the preceding note will generally cover
their absence.

This also works in the many tunes using the full major scale, but where
the seventh only occurs in descending scale runs.  Again, lengthening the
previous note will shift the tune into the major/mixolydian hexatonic and
make it playable on more instruments.

The range is too wide for the pipes and the scale doesn't fit either.  It

it is in a pipe arrangement with the offending high B dropped a fourth and
the C simply left out, even though that changes the implicit harmony:

13. Getting It Wrong
=== ================

Every possible kind of confusion about these modes has been perpetrated at
some time or other by people used to the major/minor tonal system: mishearing
pitches, "correcting" them, treating them like the passing chromaticisms of
art music and adding other chromaticisms in a misguided attempt to match,
making arrangements where the harmony was in a different mode entirely,
failing to notice gaps, assuming that all pentatonic tunes are in the same
mode, and wild speculation about their origins.

Donald Fergusson's book "Beyond the Furthest Hebrides" comments on the song
"Eilean Mo Chridhe":

        The melody of this song has become one of the most popular of all
        Hebridean melodies through its use for the English song entitled
        'Westering Home'. The same melody also became very popular through
        its use in much older songs, 'The Muckin' O' Geordie's Byre' and
        the beautiful 'Bonnie Strathyre'. 

        The scale (Hexatonic) makes interesting speculation for the 
        missing note is the 7th or leading note. As written here, the 
        scale is B flat and the 7th note should be A sharp (natural). But 
        the  mood or feel of the music, especially in "Eilean Mo Chridhe" 
        is quite melancholy. Could the missing note be A flat? If it is 
        then the scale is the ancient and popular one of so much Gaelic 
        melody - Mixolydian.

Someone should tell Ferguson that there are six other notes of the
chromatic pitch set missing too.  Perhaps he should get together with
the musical estate of the late Sir Arthur Sullivan and start looking
for the Lost Chord.  Ferguson's mistake is of the same type as the more
familiar one that classifies gapped modes as "major" or "minor" because
the notes they have happen to match those scales; it took the musicology
of the twentieth century to enlarge the range of possible confusions to
include mixolydian as well.

There are two persistent muddles which have almost become folk traditions
in their own right: adapting pipe tunes to the fiddle while ignoring the
tonality essential to the pipes, and the other way round.  A simple rule
of thumb: if a fiddle tune fits the range of the pipes and has a G sharp
in it, chances are it was adapted from the pipes and the fiddler/editor
screwed up.

John Curwen, in his text on the sol-fa system, gives an interesting example
of folk intuition fighting back against the "common practice" tonal system.
This old psalm tune dates from the earliest days of the Reformation and was
one of the most widely sung in Scotland:

This proved impossible for most people in England and even more in Scotland,
particularly in the Highlands, to sing without instrumental accompaniment
(which in Scotland was prohibited for centuries).  They found two alternate
strategies for dealing with the sharpened seventh they'd had foisted on them.
One was to ignore the books and carry on singing what they had always done.
The other was to replace the seventh (the third in the major chord) with
a fifth (the root of the major chord).  This, after a cascade of melodic
adjustments, finally led to a new tune, back in the same mode as "Dundee":

14. Outwith Scotland

These modes are not the exclusive property of the Scots; neither do they
define any kind of "Celtic" musical idiom.  I've concentrated on Scottish
music because that's what I understand best, but many of these modes occur
everywhere in Europe, and some much further afield.

16. Tonally Un-Scottish Scottish Music
=== ==================================

The 18th century saw the introduction of new harmonic and melodic forms
from Italy, France, Germany and England.  Sometimes these were adopted
wholesale, but there were some unusual fusions of the European style
with the native one, like this reel by the leading Scottish art-music
composer of the mid-18th century, the Earl of Kelly:

X:0

  bgdg GBgb|afcf  Fc  fa       |bgaf gdcB|Af  d/c/B/A/  BG G|]

While that tune uses an Italian harmonic progression inspired by Corelli,
it still leaves out the sixth to fit the dorian/minor hexatonic scale.
Many fiddle tunes of this period have a similar structure, and for some
reason I don't understand nearly all of them are in G minor or were
first published in that key.

The innovations of the nineteenth century that now feature in every
Scottish dance band's repertoire - like "Gaelic waltzes" and polkas -
were harder to assimilate.  Some are older traditional tunes given
new rhythms: others are impossible to adapt to scales with gaps or
non-diatonic modes, like these tunes with sections in different keys
and key changes within sections as well:

17. Cautionary Notes
=== ================

All the above is somewhat oversimplified: in fact the pitches of Scottish
traditional music are rarely taken from the twelve-note equally-tempered
scale (except for instruments like the accordion that offer no choice in
the matter).  The precise tuning of notes in the scale may be modified to
get purer harmonies or (particularly with Cape Breton fiddling) to imitate
the sound of the bagpipe scale on other instruments.  When this happens,
relative modes need not have exactly the same pitch set; a fiddler may
bend the notes of an A mixolydian tune to bring it closer to the bagpipe
pitch set, while playing a D major tune in something close to the equally
tempered pitch set.  ABC does not yet handle microtonality: when it does
I'll return to this issue.

The other oversimplification I've made is in reducing modes to bare
sequences of notes.  In Middle Eastern and Indian music theory, the
notion of a mode (raga, makam, dastgah) includes a set of melodic
formulas used with it - short fragments that are used to put melodies
together, particularly at cadences.  This happens to some extent in
Scottish traditional music; think of all the hornpipes in G major that
end with BGG or GBG.  In modern music theory the "sequence of pitches"
idea of mode I've used here is more often called "octave species", and
"mode" now tends to be used in the West Asian manner, as this is also
helpful in analyzing mediaeval and Renaissance art music.  I hope to
come back to this some time and write a comparable document on the
melodic formulas of Scottish music.


18. References
=== ==========

A good reference to music theory as applied to jazz, which includes a
fair bit of material on modes, is Marc Sabatella's on-line textbook at
<http://www.outsideshore.com/primer/primer/index.html> .  Peter Wilton
has a page <http://www.beaufort.demon.co.uk/modes.htm> with a tutorial on
the modes of Gregorian chant.  A compendious encyclopaedia of folk music
(albeit with an American slant) is on Bill Markwick's "Folk File" at
<http://www.cgrg.ohio-state.edu/~spencer/FF/> ; it has links to information
about intonation and temperament.

B.H. Bronson, "The Traditional Tunes of the Child Ballads", is a massive
four-volume collection which uses a scheme similar to mine.  Phil Taylor
uses both the Bronson scheme and something like mine in the tutorial
material for BarFly <http://www.barfly.dial.pipex.com>.

There are many good collections of Scottish tunes, but there are so many
good Scottish tunes to collect that no one book can possibly do it all.
The best value for money, and the first one any instrumentalist should
get, is Kerr's "Merry Melodies", a four-volume set with hundreds of tunes
in each volume.  This has been continuously in print for over a century.
Less densely printed (and hence more readable) collections of about the
same period are the "Skye Collection" and the recently reprinted "Athole
Collection" and "Glen Collection", both aimed at fiddlers.  There are many
competing collections of bagpipe music, with a lot of overlap in their
traditional material; the Scots Guards book is the most comprehensive, but
costs an arm and a leg.  Players of other instruments have to make do with
books aimed at either fiddlers or pipers; the last comparable collections
for the flute were done 150 years ago and no large anthology of Scottish
music has ever been compiled for any other instrument, though there are
many smaller collections for piano.

For songs, there has only ever been one try at a comprehensive collection,
the "Scots Musical Museum" of Johnson and Burns, and that was more than
200 years ago.  It has been reprinted, and it says something about song
scholarship in Scotland that it doesn't really have any competition.  For
the bare tunes, Nathaniel Gow's "Vocal Melodies of Scotland" is comparable,
but has never been reprinted since the early 19th century.  G.F. Graham's
"The Popular Songs and Melodies of Scotland" has good historical notes but
is not on the same scale.  A very much bigger effort is the Greig-Duncan
Folksong Collection, in eight volumes from the School of Scottish Studies
and Aberdeen University Press; however, this is basically one man's work,
what he could collect from the north-east of Scotland at the turn of the
century, and there are many songs familiar all over Scotland that he didn't
get round to.  Campbell & Collinson's "Hebridean Folksongs" is the largest
collection of Gaelic songs edited to a reasonable standard, but it leaves
out many of the most popular ones.  Most practical editions of Gaelic songs
are in sol-fa notation and are hard to come by outside Scotland.
