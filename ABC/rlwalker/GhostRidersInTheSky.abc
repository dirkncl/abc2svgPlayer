W:1
W:[Bm]An old cowpoke went riding out one [D]dark and windy day
W:Up[Bm]on a ridge he rested as he went upon his way
W:When [Bm]all at once a [G/B]mighty herd of [E/B]red-eyed cows he [G/B]saw
W:[G]coming through the ragged [Em]sky, and [Bm]up a cloudy draw
W:2
W:Their [Bm]brands were still on fire and their [D]hot breath he could feel
W:Their [Bm]horns were black and shiny and their hooves were made of steel
W:A [Bm]bolt of fear went [G/B]through him as they [E/B]rumbled through the [G/B]sky
W:Then he [G]saw the riders coming hard,[Em]     and he [Bm]heard their mournful cry
W:CHORUS
W:Yippe-ai-[D]ay, yippee-ai-[Bm]oh [A]
W:[G]Ghost riders [Em]in the [Bm]sky
W:3
W:As the [Bm]riders loped on by him, he [D]heard one call his name
W:If you [Bm]want to save your soul from hell, a riding on this range
W:Then [Bm]cowboy change your [G/B]ways today or [E/B]with us you will [G/B]ride
W:[G]Trying to catch the devil's herd[Em],    a[Bm]cross these endless skies
