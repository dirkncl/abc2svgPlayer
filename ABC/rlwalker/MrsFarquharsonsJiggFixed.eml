Subject: Re: [abcusers] What software will translate this correctly?

| I just completed a transcription of Robert Petrie's 1st tunebook 
| (Scottish, 1790), which has parts for violin and cello.  I wrote the 
| code using Phil Taylor's BarFly, on which this reads and plays 
| correctly, but it appears that a lot of other abc software can't 
| handle the multiple voices.  Below is a sample tune; I'd be interested 
| to know what other readers and midi players can handle this code, 
| especially any PC software (for reference, the 2nd note in the 3rd 
| staff bass line is middle C).  Thanks for any help, or suggestions for 
| improving the portability of this code! -Steve

I tried it with the original abc2ps,  Jef  Moine's  abcm2ps,  and  my
jcabc2ps.   They  all  handled it.  The original abc2ps had two minor
problems: It doesn't accept V: lines in  the  header  section,  so  I moved  them  to after the K: line.  And it can't handle the spaces in the "name = " term, so I removed them.  The result looked like:

[V:2] z|C3      E3 |  F3    G3 | c3     e3   | d2f b2B  |
...

This worked without problems in all three abc2ps clones.  There  were some  warnings about the unrecognized "transpose" term, but that's to be expected from a program  that  doesn't  produce  pitches,  and  it didn't  effect  the output at all.  All three programs produced pages that look identical.

Actually, the original abc2ps doesn't implement the middle= term, and it gave a warning about that.  But it assumes middle=d for bass clef, so it worked. Jef and I have both implemented it. Tunes that expect a different  mapping  than  middle=d for bass come out strange with the original abc2ps.  Lots and lots of leger lines ...
