B:Whatever I Wish To Call This Book

% From the index page:
% This special collection of Old Favorite Melodies, Patriotic Songs, and College Songs,
% together with some of the newer songs of unusual excellence, we mail, prepaid
% for 10c a copy.  Special rates for quantity lots.

% This was a little stapled soft-cover booklet of tunes published by this piano manufacturer
% in 1919.  Under U.S. copyright law, all of the material in this booklet is now in the
% public domain.

% The booklet actually contained 102 songs, plus a blank page for "your state song."
% The booklet doesn't specify which of the 102 songs is not one of the "best."

% Transcribed by John Atchley, guitarnut.com
% This isn't by any means a rare booklet, but most existing copies are in pretty
% bad shape as they were printed on very poor quality paper.  I scanned all of the
% pages at very high resolution and will be archiving the images to CD, along with
% some other books I am transcribing.  If you really need the original source for
% one of these songs let me know and I can e-mail you the scanned image (the full-
% resolution images are about 3.8mb each, though).
