It's Clerk, pronounced Clark, but I imagine it's been spelled every way
possible.

It's in The Beauties of Gow (1819) Book 1, page 23, where it's annotated
"by Nath: Gow". It's also in Cole's 1000 Fiddle tunes as "Sir George
Clark's", The Fiddle Music of Scotland (Jas Hunter, 1979), and The
Scottish Country Dance Book 20 (1959) with "Mrs Ramsay of Barnton".

I have it on Ron Gonella's "Tribute to Niel Gow" but I shouldn't think
it's easily available now. He plays it with "Flora Macdonald's Lament"
(Niel Gow jr)/"Sir George Clerk of Penicuik" (Nath Gow)/"Ayr Races" (John
Gow), the last being a jig.

Would you consider is going into Em? The above mentioned "Mrs Ramsay of
Barnton" might fit:

T:Mrs Ramsay of Barnton
B:RSCDS Book 20
Z:Nigel Gatherer
