CANDY KISSES
Words and music by George Morgan

[A7] candy [D] kisses ... [D7] wrapped in [G] paper ...
Mean more to [D] you ... than [E7] any of mine [A7] ...
Candy kisses [D] ... wrapped in [G] paper ...
You'd rather [D] have them ... [A7] any old [D] time. ... [D7]

You don't [G] mean it ... when you [D] whisper ...
Those sweet [E7] love words ... in my ear [A7] ...
Candy [D] kisses ... [D7] wrapped in [G] paper ...
Mean more to [D] you ... than [A7] mine do [D] dear.

I built a castle out of dreams, dear
I thought that you were building, too
Now my castles all have fallen
And I am left alone and blue.

Once my heart was filled with gladness
Now there's sadness, only tears
Candy kisses, wrapped in paper
Mean more to ou than mine do dear.
