"Ghost riders in the sky"


Bm                                 D
An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
  Bm
Upon a ridge he rested as he went upon his way
     Bm            (G/B)         (E/B)            (G/B)
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
G                         (Em)     Bm
coming through the ragged sky, and up a cloudy draw

      Bm                                  D
Their brands were still on fire and their hot breath he could feel
      Bm
Their horns were black and shiny and their hooves were made of steel
  Bm               (G/B)               (E/B)               (G/B)
A bolt of fear went through him as they rumbled through the sky
        G                          (Em)        Bm
Then he saw the riders coming hard,     and he heard their mournful cry


CHORUS

         D             Bm    (A)
Yippe-ai-ay, yippee-ai-oh
G           (Em)    Bm
Ghost riders in the sky


       Bm                         D
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
       Bm
If you want to save your soul from hell, a riding on this range
     Bm                (G/B)         (E/B)            (G/B)
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
G                              (Em)    Bm
Trying to catch the devil's herd,    across these endless skies
